# Multi-Agent Maintenance System

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-agent maintenance system for simulating the coordination and optimization of maintenance activities across a fleet of equipment. The system utilizes a collection of specialized agents, including maintenance agents, monitor agents, and various support agents, to monitor equipment health, plan and execute maintenance actions, and optimize the overall maintenance strategy.

The key features of this system include:
- Real-time monitoring of equipment health and failure probability
- Automated maintenance planning and execution
- Optimization of maintenance actions based on cost, resources, and priority
- Learning and adaptation of maintenance strategies over time

## Environment Setup
1. Install Python 3.8 or later.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   - On Windows: `python -m venv venv` and `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Install the project in editable mode using `pip install -e .`.

## Key Components
The main components of the multi-agent maintenance system are:

1. **Agents**:
   - `MaintenanceAgent`: Responsible for executing maintenance actions, recording maintenance history, and optimizing maintenance strategies.
   - `MonitorAgent`: Monitors the health and status of individual equipment units, triggering maintenance requests as needed.
   - `KnowledgeAgent`: Maintains a shared understanding of the system's state and provides insights to other agents.
   - `DiagnosticAgent`: Analyzes equipment data to detect anomalies and predict failures.
   - `PlanningAgent`: Coordinates the maintenance activities and optimizes the overall maintenance plan.

2. **Simulation**:
   - `MaintenanceSimulation`: The central class that orchestrates the simulation, including initializing agents, connecting them, and running the main simulation loop.
   - `SensorDataGenerator`: Generates realistic sensor data for the simulated equipment.

3. **Models**:
   - `FailurePredictor`: Predicts the likelihood of equipment failures based on sensor data and historical maintenance records.
   - `AnomalyDetector`: Identifies anomalies in equipment behavior that may indicate potential issues.
   - `Scheduler`: Optimizes the maintenance schedule based on factors like cost, resources, and priority.

## Usage Instructions
1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Python 3.8 or later.
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   - Install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the simulation:
   - Customize the configuration settings in `config/config.yaml` as needed.
   - Execute the example script `examples/run_simulation.py` to start the simulation.

3. Interpret the results:
   - The simulation will generate a `simulation.log` file with detailed logs of the agents' activities and the overall system performance.
   - Review the log file and the performance metrics reported at the end of the simulation to understand the system's behavior and effectiveness.
